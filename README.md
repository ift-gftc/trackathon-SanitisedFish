# SanitisedFish

Supply chains are complex and non-deterministic, it's not always possible to know where a product has come from or where it might be going to (the essence of traceability). Just as the fisherman who catches the Tuna doesn't know if it will end up in a high-end restaurant, a can or in pre-made sushi, the sushi maker does not necessarily know who caught their fish. Discovery of the chain of custody of the product is a key feature in supporting EPCIS and Fish Supply Chain traceability. When the supply chain is not clear, the discovery service needs to be public or semi-public, however the raw data in EPCIS Visilibity Events is highly sensitive. Our solution demonstrates how data can be sanitised, shared and discovered without risk of exposing commercially sensitive data.
